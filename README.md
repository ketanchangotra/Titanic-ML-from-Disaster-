### Motivation
A simple prediction problem in the world of Data Science which provides a lot a flexibility to try data exploration and modeling techniques. It is also the most famous Kaggle competition for which there have been numerous submissions. It looks simple but getting a high accuracy score is difficult.

### File Description
All the required files are available in this repository.

1. The Notebook file contains the Exploration of the Training data and submission of the Testing data in Jupyter Notebook
2. train is the training set to be used for training the models
3. test is the file to be used for predicting the "Survived" variable.

### Result
The Optimized model scored 0.87  F-Score.

### Installation
Most of the libraries are taken care of if Anaconda is already installed. For XGBoost, use code pip install XGBoost in the Anaconda prompt.

### Acknowledgement
Kaggle notebooks available at [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks) presented numerous ideas.
